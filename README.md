# E-Commerce Back End (Mod13 SQL/Sequelize Challenge)

## Description

I created this project to work on my Sequelize, SQL, and Express.js skills. I think creating a SQL/Sequelize database for an e-commerce back end is interesting and I know that SQL is a very in demand skill to know. I really enjoyed using Sequelize. I learned quite a bit about Sequelize while doing this project, but also surprised to help solidify some of my Express.js skills and look at MySQL from a different angle.

## Installation

To install this application, you must do a git clone of the repository onto your computer.

Once you have the repo on your computer, you must log into your MySQL shell and do this command 'SOURCE db/schema.sql;'.

Then, exit the MySQL shell and type in the terminal while in the root directory for this repo 'node run seeds'. This will seed your newly created database.

Once that is done, you must create a .env file in your root directory and enter the following, each on their own line: DB_NAME='ecommerce_db', DB_PASSWORD='', and DB_USER='', while inserting your MySQL password and username in between their respective ''.

Once that is all done, type 'npm start' in your terminal while in the root directory for the repo and the server should start! You can then use Insomnia or your favorite program to perform GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE fetch requests.

## Usage

Make sure you've followed the installation instructions above. Ensure that your server is running by performing an "npm start" command in your terminal window at the root level of the repo.

Please follow the video walkthroughs. You will need to use Insomnia or a similar program to perform the GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE fetch requests to your server.

Use localhost:3001 and the respective routes. If you need to know each of the routes, please check the routes files as I have annotated them there.
